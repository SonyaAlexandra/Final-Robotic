# Final-Robotic
A group project for final robotic subject

This is my final project for the Robotics course in my IoT concentration. We combine a car robot and a robotic arm into one system â€” and also add fire detection as an extra feature. So I built a smart robot that can move forward, avoid obstacles using PID, pick up objects using a 4-servo robotic arm, and detect fire with a flame sensor (then turn on a fan to blow it out).
